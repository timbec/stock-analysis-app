This was inspired by a blog post in Jet Brains: Django Project Ideas. I hadn't used Django in a couple of years and I wanted to build with it again because I like the framework and Python generally. This was the description: 

>Stock exchange analysis
Build a stock market analysis platform using Django, a project that combines data science, machine learning, and the Django REST framework. It also offers more practical experience in handling lots of real-time data. 

>Import historical stock prices, run technical analyses, and generate predictions using machine learning. Create RESTful APIs for data retrieval and analysis results, and integrate external APIs for real-time market data. Implement visualization tools to display trends, predictions, and alerts.

Thus far, I'm able to read data from a CSV, as well as bring in data from yfinance. The data is stored in a PostGreSQL database and display in a list, then data for each stock displayed on its own page. 

Next steps will be: 
1) generate vizualizations
2) run technical analysis
3) generate predictions using machine learning
4) create RESTful APIs to bring in real-time data. 
5) make the interface more user friendly, possibly using Typescript.
